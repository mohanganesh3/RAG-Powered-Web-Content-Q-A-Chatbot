RAG-Powered Web Content Q&A Chatbot
Imagine a chatbot that can dive into any website and answer your questions with precision, pulling insights directly from the site‚Äôs content. This project creates an AI-powered chatbot that does just that, using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to deliver accurate and contextually relevant responses based on website content.
What We Will Build
In this project, we will build an AI chatbot that can:

Extract and process content from any given website.
Answer user queries based on the retrieved website content.
Use RAG to enhance response quality by combining retrieved information with generative AI capabilities.

Brief Explanation of How RAG Works
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines two key processes:

Retrieval: The system fetches relevant information from an external source (in this case, a website).
Augmentation: The retrieved information is used to enrich the AI‚Äôs response.
Generation: The language model generates a response by combining its pre-trained knowledge with the augmented context.

How Does RAG Work?

Text Vectorization: Website content is converted into vector representations for efficient similarity searches.
Similarity Search: The system identifies text chunks most relevant to the user‚Äôs query by comparing vectors.
Augmentation: Relevant text is included in the prompt to guide the AI‚Äôs response generation.

This approach ensures the chatbot provides answers that are both informed by the website‚Äôs content and enhanced by the AI‚Äôs understanding, resulting in accurate and relevant responses.

Step-by-Step Guide to Building the Chatbot
Step 1: Set Up Your Environment
Install the required libraries by running:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Create a .env file to securely store your API key:
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key

Step 2: Load and Process Website Content
The chatbot uses requests and BeautifulSoup to extract text from a website. The content is then split into smaller chunks using langchain-text-splitters and stored in a FAISS vector store with custom embeddings for efficient retrieval.
from utils import extract_website_content, split_text_into_chunks, create_vectorstore

website_content = extract_website_content(website_url)
chunks = split_text_into_chunks(website_content)
vectorstore = create_vectorstore(chunks)

Step 3: Set Up the Conversational AI Chain
The chatbot leverages langchain-groq with the llama3-70b-8192 model to generate responses. A RAG pipeline retrieves relevant chunks from the vector store and uses them to augment the AI‚Äôs prompt.
from utils import generate_rag_response

response = generate_rag_response(user_query, vectorstore)

Step 4: Build the Streamlit Interface
The chatbot features an interactive web interface built with Streamlit. Users can input a website URL, process its content, and ask questions. The interface displays chat history and provides sample questions to guide interaction.
import streamlit as st

st.title("üåê Chat with Any Website")
website_url = st.text_input("Enter website URL:", "https://example.com")
process_button = st.button("Process Website")
if process_button:
    st.session_state.website_content = extract_website_content(website_url)
    st.session_state.chunks = split_text_into_chunks(st.session_state.website_content)
    st.session_state.vectorstore = create_vectorstore(st.session_state.chunks)
    st.session_state.process_clicked = True

Step 5: Testing and Demo
Run the Streamlit app with:
streamlit run app.py

Enter a website URL, click "Process Website," and start asking questions. The chatbot will retrieve relevant content and generate answers based on the website‚Äôs text.
Demo ExampleWebsite Used: https://example.comQuery: "What is the main topic of this website?"Response: The chatbot retrieves relevant chunks and generates a concise answer, such as: "The main topic of the website is to provide a placeholder example for web development and testing purposes."

Features

Website Processing: Extracts and processes content from any accessible website.
Interactive Chat: Maintains chat history and supports dynamic Q&A.
Sample Questions: Provides suggested questions to help users explore the website‚Äôs content.
Custom Styling: Includes a clean, user-friendly interface with custom CSS.

Extending the Chatbot
You can enhance the chatbot by:

Supporting multiple websites simultaneously.
Integrating additional data sources (e.g., PDFs or APIs).
Customizing for specific use cases like e-commerce, education, or customer support.
Adding advanced features like voice input or multilingual support.

Requirements
See requirements.txt for the full list of dependencies, including:

streamlit==1.31.1
langchain-groq==0.1.2
faiss-cpu==1.7.4
requests==2.31.0
beautifulsoup4==4.12.2

Notes

Ensure a valid GROQ API key is provided in the .env file or sidebar.
The chatbot relies on a simple deterministic embedding function to avoid external dependencies, but you can replace it with more advanced embeddings (e.g., from Hugging Face) for better performance.
Some websites may restrict scraping; ensure compliance with their terms of service.
